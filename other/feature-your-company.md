# How to be featured here

Is your organization using Kita? That's great!

If you would like your organization to have its logo featured in this list, here's how you do it! You can submit your organization, your logo and other few relevant details by following these steps:

1. Fork the [Kita documentation repository](https://github.com/kitajs/docs) on GitHub
2. Add the logo in the `static/img/organizations` folder

Please make sure that your logo complies to the following specs:

 - Encoded in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format
 - Be reasonably optimized/minified _(you can use [imageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/))_
- Make sure image "width" or "height" are explicitly specified in the "svg" tag

Update the `static/data/organizations.yml` file with a new entry

Your entry must provide:

- `name`: the name of your organization
- `image`: the filename of the logo you added in the previous step
- `link`: a link to a website that represents your organization

Submit the PR!

As soon as your PR is reviewed and merged, your awesome logo will appear in this page!
